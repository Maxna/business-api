# Business API Code Review
#### _Java Week 4 project by: **Matt Nardoni**_



## Description

A small business database developed in Java on Intellij that will take inputs for project services and a project description for each development project. The projects will also have a title that can be edited after creation. The home page of the app will have some information about the business as well as a list of all the projects completed. For each project the user should be able to view its description or services, and add, update, or delete services if needed.
